In marine and freshwater ecosystems, and especially for fish, your size often determines who you are. On land a small lion will not be eaten by a zebra, but in the ocean a tiny tuna can easily become a prey to an anchovy.  

Fish size diversity, or more specifically, the numbers of large fish are important for fish population reproductive capacity and resilience, for ecological role different species have in an ecosystem. Large fish are also important for humans – economically, culturally, spiritually. They are amazing creatures depicted in stories and myths of most cultures.  

But fish sizes are changing and size diversity is rapidly being lost. This is first and mostly due to fishing. Most harvested fish populations consist largely of young individuals that never get a chance to grow big. Fish sizes are also changing due to global warming, although we don’t yet fully understand how.  

This project aims to document and understand how fish sizes have been and are being changed by humans, what we have lost already, how can we restore it, and why it is important.
