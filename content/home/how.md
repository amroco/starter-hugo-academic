Step 1: collect available fish size data from diverse sources. We focus on coastal and freshwater fish species, because these species are most often encountered by people in their lives and also often fall into so called ‘data-poor’ fisheries. We aim to collect fish body size data from as many sources as possible - underwater surveys, underwater cameras, historical sources, local fish markets, recreational anglers, artisanal fishers, citizen science.  

Step 2: Apply size-based theory and a range of statistical analyses to infer and estimate from (initially) limited number of observations size distributions of fish species in specific locations and time. Assess how these observed size distributions differ from what would be expected. Do this for as many species as possible, including those that are never harvested by humans, in densely populated and remote locations.  

Step 3: document fish size ‘deficits’ through space and time, to inform what we are missing and what we can change.
