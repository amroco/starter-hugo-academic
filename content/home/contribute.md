Here are different ways how you can contribute to this project 

Help us collect data on fish sizes in your local area. Whether you are an angler, artisanal fisher, spearfishing enthusiast, diver, or like going to a local fish market, please tell us what size fish you see. You can use our simple FishSizeProject app, upload photos (with size, location and time) online, or send them by email.  

Do you have historical photos of fish sizes in your local area? Help us collect historical information on how big the fish could get. You can upload photos to our app with information on location and time. Even if you don’t know the exact fish size in the photo, we still value this information, as long as there is a human reference point in the photo (e.g. holding the fish). If you have other important sources of historical information, please also get in touch with us. 

If you have expertise in local fish identification, please help us make sure that photos of fish we collect are correctly identified to help minimise errors in our data. Please get in touch with us if you are interested.  

If you would like to help communicate the message, spread the word around, start a local project, contribute IT skills, contribute with beautiful drawings, write a popular science article, or help in other ways – get in touch.
